## Usage

This is the basic usage, you can get values (specifying a default value or not) and save values like so:

```kotlin
// create an singleton instance
val pref = PowerPref.getInstance(this)

// get item 
pref.getString("key",null)

// save method save item all supported sharedPreferences
pref.save("key","your value")

```

But I highly  Recommend to use singleton class

create an object 
```kotlin
Setting.kt
```
